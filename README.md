Microscope [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rebelhold/microscope.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rebelhold/microscope)
================

A microcosm for organizational budget dispersal and agile project building

This document is a work in progress

Installation
------------

Installation is pretty straight forward:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/rebelhold/microscope.git
cd microscope
npm install
npm test
```

Starting
--------

Simple is better: ```npm start```

Developing
----------

We encourage active development, that's why we use the GPL-3.0+. We believe that every developer that finds something cool to add to this platform, should be encouraged to do so.

We are trying to make things easy for you:

# You can spin up tests using ```npm test```
# Using ```npm start``` uses nodemon
# And we've built in a wireframe tool to help you quickly mock out new views, flip through them, and share them with others interested

On that note, if you want to add anything just fork the repo, write a test, make it pass, and give us a pull request. We look forward to what you come up with!
