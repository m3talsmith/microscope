A microfunding platform for public ownership.

This document is a work in progress

Core Ideas
----------

In order to decrease unemployment, wealth disparity, taxes, and to increase social programs, public impact, and public involement in their political system, we need to have a system or systems to leverage. Workers' Council is aiming to be one of those systems. We're seeking change through:

1. A system of microfunding from public funds by every citizen involved
1. A mixture of citizen and government ownership of funded projects
1. A direct market for selling and buying shared ownership in a given project
1. And liberally open sourcing every funded project to get the broadest public input possible.
